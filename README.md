Python implementation of blackjack casino card game 

'''
Cards numbered 1 to 9 have the value of 1 to 9 respecitvely.
Cards numbered 10 and jack, king and queen have the value of 10 each.
'''

> On a high level, this game has two players - user and computer.
> user bets some amount lets say X. If he wins the game amount X will be credited to his bank balance. If he loses, amount X will 
be debited form his bank balance
>At the beginning of the game user and computer both draw 2 cards. Computer shows the first card to the user.
Player starts drawing the card one by one and eventually declares his turn. Then the computer keeps drawing the card till the 
computer's total value is greater than or equal to 25 [adjusted value]


>Below is the rule of the game:

If total value of player's card exceeds the value of 35, player loses the game.
If total value of player's card is greater than computer's total card value, the player wins the game.

Hence, the player should be carefull in drawing the card since he has to keep his card value as higher than 25 as possible
but lower than 36.

Enjoy :)
